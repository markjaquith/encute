Fluent API for site owners to manipulate the scripts and styles on the frontend of their site.

== Description ==
Encute provides a fluent, declarative API for site owners to manipulate the scripts and styles that WordPress, themes, and plugins shove onto their site. Move things into the footer, defer loading, remove assets entirely. Or load scripts async, or as modules, or as nomodule!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
# How do I use this?

Go to Tools > Encute and you'll be guided through code generation.

# Can't I do this through a UI?

Not currently. This is a pro-level tool. You need to know what you're doing. If writing code isn't for you, then this plugin probably isn't for you.
